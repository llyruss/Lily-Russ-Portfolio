# <Lily-Russ-Portfolio>

## Description

I created this website to exhibit my coding work. Currently it has placeholder projects, but as I build my portfolio, I will link more projects to my site. This website will be useful for demonstating my work to future employers. 

## Installation

No installation is required to utilize my website.

## Usage

This website displays my work, includes biographical information, and contact information. To view my bio, work, contact information, and resume, use the top navigation bar. Click on each project to view the work I have created as I learn to code. Use the footer nav bar to contact me via phone, email, github, Twitter, or Spotify.
